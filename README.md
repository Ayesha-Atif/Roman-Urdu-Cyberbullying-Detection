# Cyberbullying Detection and Abuser Profile Identification on Social Media in Roman Urdu
This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on detecting cyberbullying on social media using ML classifiers and a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a system that can automatically detect instances of cyberbullying in social media content. The project involves training machine learning classifiers and utilizing a GRU model to analyze text data and make predictions about whether a particular message contains cyberbullying content or not.

### Dataset
We have created a custom dataset for this project, specifically curated and labeled for cyberbullying detection. The dataset includes a diverse range of social media messages, covering different platforms and scenarios.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Dataset/: This directory contains the necessary data files.
- Models/: Here, you can find the trained ML classifiers and the GRU model for cyberbullying detection.
- Results/: Here, you can find the results of trained models in form of graphs and table.
